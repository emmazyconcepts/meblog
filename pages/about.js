            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              MeetAnEscort was born from a simple but crucial observation: sex
              workers often lack access to reliable, practical safety
              information tailored to their specific needs. In an industry where
              safety can mean the difference between life and death, this
              information gap is unacceptable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              We started as a small initiative to compile and share safety tips
              within our community. What began as informal guides shared among
              friends has grown into a comprehensive resource platform trusted
              by thousands.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Today, we committed to expanding our reach and impact, always
              guided by our core principle:
              <strong className="text-pink-600">
                {" "}
                every sex worker deserves to work safely and with dignity.
